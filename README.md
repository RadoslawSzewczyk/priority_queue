# PriorityQueue Project

## Overview
This project implements a generic PriorityQueue class in C++. The `PriorityQueue` class provides efficient priority queue operations using a linked list structure, ensuring dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory as items are added and removed.

## Features
- Templated implementation allowing for storing any data type.
- Key operations: `push`, `pop`, `top`, `empty`, `size`, `contains`, `serialize`, `deserialize`.
- Exception handling for operations like `pop` and `top` on an empty queue.
- Serialization and deserialization support for easy data storage and retrieval.

## Getting Started
To use the `PriorityQueue` class in your project, include the `queue.h` header file in your C++ source file:
